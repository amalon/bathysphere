A \__/ B \__/ C

starts just soft:
grav
resistance

A \_
    \_B \__/ C

tight,
soft:
grav
resistance
hard:
pull on B towards A


for each object add soft constraint forces
for each object add hard constraint forces
advance by forces
for each object implement hard constraints
  move objects so constraints aren't disatisfied?
  alter velocities in reaction.
clear forces
