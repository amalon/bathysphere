bathysphere
[ ] red internal lighting
[ ] bolted windows
[ ] currents around when moving
    [ ] 
[ ] external spot lights
[ ] submarine hatch
[ ] compressed gas cylinders + piping
[ ] LCD screens with readouts of various bits
    [ ] depth
    [ ] internal pressure
    [ ] external pressure
    [ ] oxygen + CO2
[ ] swively + springy chair
[ ] circular desk
    [ ] map screens
    [ ] radar screen
    [ ] writing space
    [ ] microphone
[ ] random objects
    [ ] clock
    [ ] big red button

strands
[ ] fix rope sim
    [ ] allow tension in both directions

cord
[X] textured

kelp
[ ] texture? fix colouring

tether
[X] thick flexible cord
[O] textured cylinder made up of multiple control points
[X] spline curves in between
[X] each control point constrained to next by max distance
[X] when theres slack, the points move with the currents

water
[O] continuous 3d field of currents
    [O] using some function of position and time
    [ ] along with extras like depending on bathysphere
[O] water surface affected by currents underneith (integration of function)
[ ] lots of bits of crap, general particles moving around near camera
    [ ] when one goes out of range on one side another is created at similar
    [ ] position on other side
[X] provides water resistance

surface
[ ] altitude function
[ ] minimum subdivision so plants etc can be apropriately rooted
[X] some form of texture for surface
[X] sun glare through water
    [X] rays
    [X] flare

collision detection
[ ] 

bubbles
[X] simple particles accelerating upwards
